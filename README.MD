#"Hello! This is a classical Game of Life game invited by John Conway. " 
#
#"A living cell is blue. It survives only when surrounded by two other cells. " "A new cell is born if surrounded by three cells. Every cell dies when it is has less or more neighbours."
#
#"Please, use the mouse to build any lifeform that you like! You can add more cells while the evolution is running :)" 
#"Fase One - highlights the cells that are dying(red), newborn(green) and survived(blue)."
#
#"Fase Two - finishes the turn with removing dead cells and establishing newborn and survived cells." 
#
#"Proceed fases - combines both fases in one step." 
#
#"Contaminate - randomly fills the field with live cells." 
#
#"Clear - clears the field. The field is resizable and every change of sizes clears the field." 
#
#"Timer - starts the Life game until stopped." 
#
#"The game was programmed as an array of labels. The mathematical model is based on subtraction of fields with cells. 
#"The program calculates sums of cells that are to the right and down from a target cell and subtract them. " 
#
#"Have fun!"
